You're given a 2D array of integers matrix .
Write a function that returns the transpose of the matrix.
The transpose of a matrix is a flipped version of the original matrix across its main diagonal (which runs
from top-left to bottom-right);
it switches the row and column indices of the original matrix.
You can assume the input matrix always has at least 1 value;
however its width and height are not necessarily the same.

Sample Input #1
matrix = [
 [1, 2],
]
Sample Output # 1
[
 [1],
 [2]
]

Sample Input #2
matrix = [
 [1, 2],
 [3, 4],
 [5, 6]
]
Sample Output #2
[
 [1, 3, 5],
 [2, 4, 6]
]
