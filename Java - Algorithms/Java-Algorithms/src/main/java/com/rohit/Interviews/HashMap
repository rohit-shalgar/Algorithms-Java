Data Structure: HashMap uses a hash table data structure to store key-value pairs.

Null Keys and Values: HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values.

Performance: The average time complexity for basic operations (get, put, remove) is O(1) under normal circumstances (assuming a good hash function and properly distributed hash codes).

Key Features:
Hashing and Buckets:

Each key-value pair is stored in an internal array called a bucket.
The bucket index is determined by hashing the key using the hashCode() method of the key object.
If multiple keys hash to the same index (collision),
 they are stored in the same bucket using a linked list
(or tree in Java 8+ for performance improvements).

Collision Handling:

When two or more keys produce the same hash code (and hence the same bucket index),
 a collision occurs.
In HashMap, collisions are typically resolved using a technique called chaining:
Each bucket contains a linked list (or in Java 8+ versions, a tree) of key-value pairs.
When a collision happens,
the new key-value pair is added to the existing linked list at that bucket.


Differences Summary:
Ordering:

HashMap: Does not maintain order.
LinkedHashMap: Maintains insertion order.
TreeMap: Maintains sorted order based on keys.
Underlying Data Structure:

HashMap and LinkedHashMap: Use hash tables.
TreeMap: Uses a red-black tree.
Performance:

HashMap and LinkedHashMap: O(1) average-case time complexity for basic operations.
TreeMap: O(log n) time complexity for basic operations due to the tree structure.
Iterating Order:

HashMap: Iteration order is not specified.
LinkedHashMap: Iteration order is insertion order.
TreeMap: Iteration order is sorted order based on keys.
